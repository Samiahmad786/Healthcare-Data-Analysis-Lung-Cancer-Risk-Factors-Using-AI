# 🤖 AI-Assisted Lung Cancer Risk Analysis using Python

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an **AI-assisted exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a healthcare dataset to identify key lifestyle, environmental, and clinical factors associated with lung cancer risk.

The analysis is performed using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, where **AI was used as a supporting tool** to structure the workflow, suggest analytical approaches, and improve insight generation.  
The project demonstrates strong **data analyst thinking, EDA skills, and decision-oriented insights**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify high-risk population segments
- Analyze the impact of smoking and passive smoking
- Study the effect of air pollution on lung health
- Understand the role of exercise in reducing risk
- Detect early warning clinical indicators
- Generate actionable insights for healthcare decision-making

---

## 🧠 Role of AI in This Project
AI was used as an **assistant** to:
- Design the overall data analysis workflow
- Suggest relevant EDA techniques and visualizations
- Improve clarity in interpretation and documentation
- Support faster and more structured analysis

> ⚠️ Note: All analysis logic, execution, and interpretation were performed by the analyst. AI acted as a productivity and guidance tool, not as a decision-maker.

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized healthcare-related information, including:

- **Demographics:** age, gender, education level  
- **Lifestyle factors:** smoking status, smoking years, exercise, alcohol consumption  
- **Environmental exposure:** air pollution index, passive smoking  
- **Clinical indicators:** BMI, CRP level, oxygen saturation, FEV1  
- **Target variable:** lung_cancer_risk

## ❓ Key Analytical Questions Answered
- Do smokers have a higher lung cancer risk than non-smokers?
- Does passive smoking increase risk for non-smokers?
- How does exercise influence lung cancer risk?
- What is the impact of air pollution on lung health?
- Which clinical indicators act as early warning signals?

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Smoking and passive smoking significantly increase lung cancer risk
- High air pollution negatively impacts lung health indicators
- Regular exercise shows a protective effect against lung cancer
- CRP level is a strong inflammation-based early warning indicator
- High-risk populations can be clearly segmented using demographic and lifestyle data

---

## 💡 Business & Healthcare Value
- Supports identification of high-risk groups for early screening
- Useful for preventive healthcare strategies
- Applicable for insurance risk analysis and public health planning
- Demonstrates how data analytics can drive data-informed decisions
